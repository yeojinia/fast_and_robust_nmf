# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare reconstruction errors on image data for dimensionaliy reduction.

# Fast and Robust NMF
This file is implemented from the following paper (Algorithm1) in Python for the purpose of matrix analysis. 
"N. Gillis and S.A. Vavasis, Fast and Robust Recursive Algorithms for Separable Nonnegative Matrix Factorization"
